# drumkv1 Audiophob preset

There's a distinct lack of freely available
[drumkv1](https://drumkv1.sourceforge.io/) presets, which is an entry barrier
for potential users, that, wanting to try it, aren't able to easilly do so.
Thus, drumkv1 Audiophob preset: a port of the Audiophob preset for
[hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/) you can easilly open on drumkv1
and use for any purpose.
