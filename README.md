# drumkv1 Audiophob preset

There's a distinct lack of freely available drumkv1 presets, which is an entry barrier for potential users, that, wanting to try it, aren't able to easilly try it. Thus, drumkv1 Audiophob preset: a port of the Audiophob preset for hydrogen you can easilly open on drumkv1 and use for any purpose.

# TODO
